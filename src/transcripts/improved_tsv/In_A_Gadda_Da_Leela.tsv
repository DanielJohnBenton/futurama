SPEAKER	LINE
Transition Announcer	And now, The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!  Brought to you by Bartley's Rocket Wax.
Zapp Brannigan	I wax my rocket every day.
Emperor Chop Chop	No one can save you now, Leela.
Leela Actress	Well, what about Zapp Brannigan?
Emperor Chop Chop	Well, obviously, Zapp Brannigan can save you, but—  Zapp Brannigan!
Zapp Brannigan	So, Emperor Chop Chop, once again we meet at last! Drop that space gun or I'll shoot!  Like so!
Leela Actress	Oh, Zapp!  Tie me back up and ravish me!
Zapp Brannigan	I'd like to, Leela.  So I will.
Zapp Brannigan	Ooh, yeah, shake it, baby. Shake it like—   I surrender and volunteer for treason!
Kif	Emergency summons from the President, captain.
Zapp Brannigan	Oh, it's you.  Just let me freshen up.  Computer, captain's musk.
Zapp Brannigan	The long dramatic corridor.  That's never a good sign.
Scanner	Glove recognized. Proceed, Mrs. Eisenhower.
Zapp Brannigan	Mr. President, what the hell?
Richard Nixon's Head	At ease, Brannigan.
Richard Nixon's Head	What you're about to see is highly classified. Reptillicus, hit the thingy.
Richard Nixon's Head	At 0000 hours, Planet XXX was attacked by a mysterious death sphere.
Zapp Brannigan	Magnify that death sphere.  Why's it still blurry?
Kif	That's all the resolution we have. Making it bigger doesn't make it clearer.
Zapp Brannigan	It does on CSI: Miami.
Richard Nixon's Head	They fought back with advance military hardware, but it was like shooting BB's at Bebe Rebozo.
Zapp Brannigan	That poor brave hardware.
Richard Nixon's Head	The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray.  Erased that planet like eighteen minutes of incriminating tape.
Zapp Brannigan	Oh, I just wish I understood why.  Why I should care.
Richard Nixon's Head	Because the death sphere is now on course for Earth! Rowrowooooooo!!
Zapp Brannigan	My god, we're defenseless. Like fish in a barrel.
Richard Nixon's Head	Options?
Zapp Brannigan	My instinct is to hide in this barrel.  Like the wily fish.
Richard Nixon's Head	Then we're down to our last hope.  A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy.
Professor Farnsworth	Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon!  The correct answer is: very.
Richard Nixon's Head	Alright, Professor. Sock it to me!
Professor Farnsworth	Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable.
Zapp Brannigan	How undetectable?
Professor Farnsworth	It's right in front of you.
Zapp Brannigan	I find that—OW! —to believe.
Bender	But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
Professor Farnsworth	From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.
Hermes	What vulnerable opening?
Professor Farnsworth	All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.
Zoidberg	Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a "death sphere"?
Richard Nixon's Head	I say Brannigan.
Zapp Brannigan	I say no.
Leela	I say me.
Richard Nixon's Head	I say Leela.
Leela	I say yes.
Fry	I say no.
Zapp Brannigan	I say Leela, too.
Leela	I say yes again.
Zapp Brannigan	I say I shall join her.
Leela	But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
Zapp Brannigan	There'll only be one man.  Me.  How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner?
Leela	Creeped out.
Zapp Brannigan	Then it's decided.
Leela	Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
Zapp Brannigan	It'll help us achieve maximum thrust.
Fry	I made you some trail mix for the flight.  Also this picture to remember me by.
Leela	You hold on to it.  I'll be back soon.
Professor Farnsworth	Activate stealth shielding.
Leela	Liftoff!
Zapp Brannigan	I'll rodger that.
Fry	Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
Bender	I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
Leela	Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting.   Activating the Force.
The Force	Feel the entrance, Leela. Destination on your left in...  zero point three  miles.
Zapp Brannigan	Zapp to Leela: look at all that surveillance equipment.
Leela	We better whisper.
Zapp Brannigan	Switching to pillow talk mode.
Leela	Look.  What are those huge letters?
Zapp Brannigan	"V-GINY?" Doesn't ring a bell.
Professor Farnsworth	Hmmm....
Professor Farnsworth	I don't like the looks of this "V-GINY."  Does anyone recognize those call letters?
Hermes	Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either.
Professor Farnsworth	Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding.
Leela	This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
Leela	Holy cr—
Zapp Brannigan	Incoming yucky!
Leela	Firing pocket rocket!
Zapp Brannigan	Don't panic, Leela! Go go go go go!
Leela	I hope this is the control stick!
Zapp Brannigan	Captain's Log: We've lost control.  Addendum: Whoooaa-oooooaa-ooaaaah!!!
Transition Announcer	And now, back to The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!
Zapp Brannigan	Chapter Two: "The Heat Thickens".
Zapp Brannigan	Leela, wake up! I can't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you.
Leela	Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!
Zapp Brannigan	Leela? Where are we.
Leela	We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?
Zapp Brannigan	If anyone can move it, I can.  No one can move it. Are you hurt?
Leela	No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
Zapp Brannigan	Me, too. We better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel.
Leela	Uh, I suppose so.
Zapp Brannigan	Here.  We can cover ourselves with these sticky sap-covered leaves.  I'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery.
Leela	You will?  Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later.
Zapp Brannigan	Well, I promise not to abuse the privilege. For now, I better scout around for food and water and help.
Leela	What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
Zapp Brannigan	I'm not quite sure. Perhaps it's the fresh air or a severe head injury.  In any case, I'm off.
Leela	If you see any steaks, that'd be good!
Fry	Why isn't Leela back yet?  Do you think she's okay?
Bender	How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
Fry	Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?
Bender	Shut up!
Hermes	What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!
Amy	Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?
Zoidberg	Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
Professor Farnsworth	Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!
Zoidberg	Still, a Parcheesi tournament.
Professor Farnsworth	This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.
Professor Farnsworth	And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs.
Bender	Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
Professor Farnsworth	Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again.
Zoidberg	I found the board!
Professor Farnsworth	Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision.
Fry	Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?
Professor Farnsworth	That makes the most sense of all.  Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter.   And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company.
Fry	You mean...
Amy	Aw!
Professor Farnsworth	How dare you!?
Amy	Shame on—
Hermes	So the death sphere is "censoring" indecent planets?
Professor Farnsworth	Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.
Amy	So the orgy's off?
Leela	So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
Zapp Brannigan	I couldn't find any water.  But the moisture in these fruit and nut berries should sustain you.
Leela	Thank you.
Zapp Brannigan	I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them, yet I saw no sign of intelligent life.
Leela	Bummer.
Zapp Brannigan	Moreover, the crash totally destroyed our ship.
Leela	So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
Zapp Brannigan	Alas, that may never happen.  Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate yet easy to stub your crotch on.
Leela	Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate.
Zapp Brannigan	It's a veritable Garden of Eden.
Leela	It is?
Snake	Hello.
Leela	Did that snake say, "Hello"?
Zapp Brannigan	No, we're both delirious from dehydration.
Snake	Just like Adam and Eve.
Professor Farnsworth	We can still save Earth.  People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold hard facts by rational folks like us.
Professor Farnsworth	The end is near! Repent thy sins!
Sal	I'll thinks it overs while I engages this five dollar hooker.
Fry	Don't do it! It's not worth it!
Petunia	Okay, make it three dollars.
Sal	Yuck! I don't wants no three-dollar hooker.  I'm goin' backs to the adults bookstore.
Fry	Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
Bender	Nope, pubic library.
Leela	Zapp?  Where are you?  Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him.
Snake	Maybe you two belong together.
Leela	We do not.  And you can't talk.
Snake	Oh, come on!  It must be an awful temptation.
Zapp Brannigan	Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet?  I thought I'd whip us up some shelter, make this a little more like home.
Leela	I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
Zapp Brannigan	Let's find out together.  I'll brave the ship's wreckage to fetch you the telescope.
Leela	That's so sweet.
Snake	I'm just sayin' is all.
Professor Farnsworth	I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left.
Hermes	Well, now I've heard everything  on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?
Professor Farnsworth	Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.
Professor Farnsworth	Commence purity chant.
Fry	Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.   Bender?
Bender	Aw, yeah, baby. You're quite a dish.
Professor Farnsworth	Bender, stop!! STOP!!
Bender	Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?
Leela	No!
Leela	No!  Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe!
Zapp Brannigan	Oh, God, I'm sorry, Leela.
Leela	Maybe — Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.
Zapp Brannigan	We can avoid humanity's mistakes.
Leela	Like the tuba.
Zapp Brannigan	Yes.  We'll be like Adam and Eve.
Leela	Only without the tuba.
Zapp Brannigan	And we'll beget little Zapp Jr. and Leela Jr. and they'll have kids of their ow—Yecch!  Is that really what happened in the Bible?!
Leela	It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
Zapp Brannigan	Then we'll write our own Bible, with less Sodom and more Gomorra.
Leela	Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree.  The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples!  Ow!  Wow!  Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit.
Zapp Brannigan	Thee will be done.
Leela	Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.   Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, I—I couldn't think straight.  I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me.  Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second!
Zapp Brannigan	Uh...woh...ih...Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih—I have a terrible confession to make!
Zapp Brannigan	You see, when I first went foraging, what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship.  Ignoring all danger, I charged inside to liberate our provisions.
Leela	So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
Zapp Brannigan	Yes!  I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops.  I just wanted you to think  a little better of me.
Leela	Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration.  Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!
Zapp Brannigan	Ooooooiiiiiiigeeeaaaaaaaaaah, there's plenty of water! You see...
Zapp Brannigan	...after I selflessly rescued the trail mix, I braved the flames once more in search of fluids.
Leela	Then why didn't you give me any?
Zapp Brannigan	I though it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious.
Leela	So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
Zapp Brannigan	Diiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaah, not exactly.
Zapp Brannigan	You see, besides the trail mix, the minibar also contained Doritos, beef jerky and a generous assortment of fine chocolates.
Leela	It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.   Oh, dear God!
Zapp Brannigan	Gluuuuuuuuyiiiiiiiiiiiih, it was just after we crashed!
Zapp Brannigan	I awoke first to find you trapped.
Zapp Brannigan	Leela.  Leela! Wake up!
Leela	You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
Zapp Brannigan	Well, sure.  But then I wouldn't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn't have needed.
Leela	I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed!  The ship's fully functional, isn't it?
Zapp Brannigan	Ee-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiih, you see...
Zapp Brannigan	...after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness, I paused to enjoy a cigar.  Though mellow and satisfying, it did parch me a bit.  So I went in search of brandy.  That's when my keen senses detected the still invisible ship.
Zapp Brannigan	Ow!
Leela	So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead!
Fry	Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump.  Leela? You're alive!
Leela	Fry!  But how did you find this planet?  Well?
Zapp Brannigan	Oooheeeeeeaaaaiiiiiiih, we're actually on Earth!  The ship's homing device brought us back!
Leela	But I saw Earth explode!
Zapp Brannigan	I'm actually kinda proud of this one.  You see...
Zapp Brannigan	What you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up using the ship's holographic targeting projector.  The alleged telescope was a toilet paper tube.
Leela	You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
Zapp Brannigan	My motives were pure!  I just wanted you think we had to save humanity so you'd be willing to have sex.  Please say you believe me.
Leela	Yes.  I believe you.
Fry	Yay!
Bender	There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!
Leela	Let's go home, everybody.  At least the Earth wasn't destroyed.  Yet.
V-GINY	People of Earth, hear the righteous word of the Mighty V-GINY!
Bender	The Mighty V-GINY!
V-GINY	Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed.
Professor Farnsworth	Huzzah!  The purity chant worked!
V-GINY	Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction!  I was referring to Adam and Eve.
Leela	We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series of—
V-GINY	Consummate your union or I shall destroy Earth!
Leela	Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team.
Zapp Brannigan	You what?  R-Right now?  Eh, but I need a little romance, first.  Maybe a vanilla candle or something.
V-GINY	Commence intercourse.
Zapp Brannigan	The giant guns are making me feel sort of...inadequate.  I'm not sure if I could—
Leela	Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!
Fry	For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!
V-GINY	Approved for all audiences!!
Fry	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Transition Announcer	And now, the spicy finale of The Transcredible Exploits of Zapp Brannigan!
Zapp Brannigan	That was a close call but we saved Earth.  Was it as good for you as it was for the human race?
Leela Actress	Oh, Zapp, let's save another planet right now!
